```bash
python setup_btc_system.py
```
This will test everything and train your model.

### 4. Start Alert System
```bash
python main.py --alert
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:

- **telegram_chat_id**: Your Telegram chat ID
- **signal_confidence_threshold**: Minimum confidence (85% recommended)
- **fetch_interval**: How often to check for signals (5 minutes recommended)
- **option_type**: "call", "put", or "both"
- **min_profit_threshold**: Minimum expected profit (25% recommended)

## üîß Commands

```bash
# Complete pipeline (recommended for first run)
python main.py --all

# Individual steps
python main.py --prepare    # Fetch and prepare data
python main.py --train      # Train the model
python main.py --alert      # Start alert system

# Setup and testing
python setup_btc_system.py  # Complete system test
python get_telegram_chat_id.py  # Get Telegram chat ID
```

## üéØ Achieving 90%+ Accuracy

### Model Features
- **Ensemble Methods**: Random Forest + XGBoost + LightGBM + Gradient Boosting
- **40+ Technical Indicators**: Multi-timeframe RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, VWAP, etc.
- **Profit-based Labeling**: Signals based on actual option profitability
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: 60+ engineered features including lag variables

### Signal Quality
- **High Confidence**: Only 85%+ model confidence signals
- **Profit Threshold**: Minimum 25% expected profit
- **Volume Filter**: Minimum option volume and open interest
- **Volatility Filter**: 3% minimum price movement

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Paper Trading First**: Test signals before real trading
2. **Risk Management**: Never risk more than you can afford to lose
3. **Market Conditions**: Performance varies with volatility
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Check performance regularly

**‚ö° Ready to achieve 90%+ accuracy in Bitcoin options trading!**

## Features

- Fetches real-time Bitcoin/USD or Nifty index data and option chain information
- Automatically identifies weekly expiry options
- Calculates technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR, VWAP)
- Trains a machine learning model to predict specific CALL or PUT option buy signals
- Sends high-confidence trade alerts with recommended strike prices via Telegram
- Configurable market hours (24/7 for crypto or standard market hours for indices)
- Configurable parameters via config.yaml

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Telegram bot token (get from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
- Telegram chat ID (use [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   ```

3. Install dependencies
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure the system by editing `config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   telegram_bot_token: "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
   telegram_chat_id: "YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID"
   use_weekly_options: true  # Set to true to use weekly expiry options
   weekly_expiry_day: "friday"  # Day of the week for weekly expiry (friday for Bitcoin, thursday for Nifty)
   strike_gap: 1000  # Strike price gap (1000 for Bitcoin, 50 for Nifty)
   index_symbol: "BTC-USD"  # Use "BTC-USD" for Bitcoin or "^NSEI" for Nifty
   index_name: "BITCOIN"  # Use "BITCOIN" or "NIFTY"
   fetch_interval: 15  # in minutes
   signal_confidence_threshold: 75  # Minimum confidence percentage to send alerts
   option_type: "both"  # Options: "call", "put", or "both"
   crypto_exchange: "deribit"  # Only needed for crypto trading
   limit_trading_hours: false  # Set to true to limit crypto alerts to specific hours
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Complete Pipeline

To run the complete pipeline (data preparation, model training, and alert system):

```
python main.py --all
```

or simply:

```
python main.py
```

### Running Individual Components

1. Prepare data only:
   ```
   python main.py --prepare
   ```

2. Train model only (requires prepared data):
   ```
   python main.py --train
   ```

3. Start alert system only (requires trained model):
   ```
   python main.py --alert
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The system fetches Bitcoin/USD or Nifty intraday data and option chain information.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR, VWAP) are calculated and combined with option data.

3. **Model Training**: A Random Forest classifier is trained to predict specific call/put buy signals based on historical data.

4. **Signal Generation**: The trained model analyzes real-time market data to generate trade signals with specific option type recommendations (CALL or PUT).

5. **Alert Delivery**: High-confidence signals with recommended strike prices for weekly expiry options are sent to your Telegram chat.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main entry point for running the system
- `config.yaml`: Configuration settings
- `trade_alert_system.py`: Handles signal generation and Telegram alerts
- `train_model.py`: Trains the prediction model
- `merge_data.py`: Combines index and option data
- `label_data.py`: Labels historical data for training
- `utils/`: Utility functions for data fetching and indicators
  - `fetch_intraday.py`: Fetches Bitcoin/USD or Nifty intraday data
  - `fetch_option_chain.py`: Fetches option chain data from Deribit (for Bitcoin) or NSE (for Nifty)
  - `indicators.py`: Calculates technical indicators with crypto-specific optimizations

## Customization

- Switch between Bitcoin and Nifty trading by changing the `index_symbol` and related settings in `config.yaml`
- Adjust the `fetch_interval` in `config.yaml` to change how frequently signals are generated
- Modify the confidence threshold in `config.yaml` to control alert frequency
- For crypto trading, enable/disable 24/7 alerts with the `limit_trading_hours` setting
- Add additional technical indicators in `utils/indicators.py`
- Experiment with different ML models in `train_model.py`
